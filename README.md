-It provides insights for increasing CTR (click-through rate is a metric that measures the number of clicks advertisers receive on their ads per number of impressions). 

## Objective
-Perform exploratory data analysis to derive better insight on the data
-Build the model using hyperparameter tuning
-Evaluate the model
-Deploy model using Web interface/ Dashboard
